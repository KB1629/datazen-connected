# GitHub Push Instructions

# Follow these steps in a new PowerShell window:
# 1. Navigate to your project directory:
cd C:\nifi-api-integration\DataZen

# 2. Add all files:
git add .

# 3. Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Add NiFi integration with certificate-based authentication"

# 4. Configure remote URL with your username:
git remote set-url origin https://KB1629@github.com/KB1629/DataZen.git

# 5. Push to GitHub (you'll be prompted for your password or token):
git push origin main

# If you have two-factor authentication enabled, you'll need to use a personal access token
# You can create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

# Alternative method with token (replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual token):
# git remote set-url origin https://KB1629:YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/KB1629/DataZen.git
# git push origin main
