# DataZen Implementation Plan

This document outlines the implementation plan for the DataZen ETL platform, focusing on two key sprints:

## Sprint 1: Functional Database Connections

### Objective
Enable real database connectivity for the connections page in the application, allowing users to test and store connections to PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server databases.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Backend Database Connection Logic** (2 days)
   - Update `nifiService.js` to implement the `testDatabaseConnection` function
   - Add helper functions for retrieving schema information from different database types
   - Implement database-specific connection logic for PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server

2. **API Endpoint Implementation** (1 day)
   - Update the `/api/connections` GET and POST endpoints
   - Implement a robust `/api/connections/test` endpoint
   - Add in-memory storage for connections

3. **Frontend Connection Form Enhancement** (2 days)
   - Update `ConnectionForm.tsx` to properly handle various database types
   - Implement dynamic form validation based on database type
   - Add UI for displaying schema information after successful connection

4. **Testing & Validation** (1 day)
   - Test with real database credentials
   - Verify schema information retrieval
   - Validate error handling

### Dependencies
- PostgreSQL driver for Node.js (`pg` package)
- MySQL driver for Node.js (`mysql2` package)
- SQL Server driver for Node.js (`mssql` package)

### Deliverables
- Fully functional database connection testing
- Schema information retrieval
- Connection storage for later use in ETL workflows

## Sprint 2: Dynamic NiFi Integration

### Objective
Enable dynamic configuration of NiFi processors using database connection details entered in the frontend, allowing for simplified ETL pipeline execution.

### Implementation Steps

1. **NiFi Processor Configuration API** (3 days)
   - Implement functions to dynamically update NiFi processors with connection details
   - Create API for injecting SQL queries and transformation configurations
   - Develop process group management for ETL operations

2. **Connection Mapping Logic** (2 days)
   - Build logic to map frontend connection objects to NiFi processor configurations
   - Implement dynamic JDBC URL generation
   - Create database driver mapping logic

3. **Pipeline Execution API** (2 days)
   - Develop API for executing pipelines with specified connections
   - Implement status monitoring and feedback
   - Create cleanup logic for temporary resources

4. **Frontend Pipeline Configuration UI** (3 days)
   - Build interface for selecting source and destination connections
   - Create SQL query builder/editor
   - Implement schema mapping interface

5. **Integration Testing** (2 days)
   - Test full ETL workflow between different database types
   - Validate data transfer
   - Test error handling and recovery

### Dependencies
- Completed Sprint 1 (Database Connection functionality)
- Existing NiFi integration (Manage Pipeline feature)
- NiFi instance with appropriate processors (ExecuteSQL, PutDatabaseRecord)

### Deliverables
- Dynamic NiFi processor configuration
- Pipeline execution with user-provided connection details
- ETL workflow UI

## Resources Required

### Development Resources
- Backend developer with Node.js and database experience
- Frontend developer with React/TypeScript experience
- DevOps support for NiFi configuration

### Testing Resources
- Test database instances (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server)
- NiFi test environment
- Sample datasets for ETL testing

## Timeline

| Sprint | Duration | Start Date | End Date |
|--------|----------|------------|----------|
| Sprint 1: Database Connections | 2 weeks | TBD | TBD |
| Sprint 2: Dynamic NiFi Integration | 3 weeks | TBD | TBD |

## Risks and Mitigations

### Technical Risks

1. **NiFi API Changes**
   - Risk: NiFi API might change, breaking integration
   - Mitigation: Use version-specific endpoints, implement adapter pattern

2. **Database Driver Compatibility**
   - Risk: Database drivers might have compatibility issues
   - Mitigation: Test with specific versions, implement feature detection

3. **Performance with Large Datasets**
   - Risk: Large datasets might cause performance issues
   - Mitigation: Implement batching, monitor performance metrics

### Project Risks

1. **NiFi Configuration Complexity**
   - Risk: Complex NiFi configuration might be difficult to manage
   - Mitigation: Use templates, document configurations, implement monitoring

2. **Integration Testing Challenges**
   - Risk: Testing end-to-end ETL flows might be complex
   - Mitigation: Create isolated test environments, use sample datasets

## Success Criteria

- Users can successfully connect to and test various database types
- Schema information is properly retrieved and displayed
- Connections can be saved and reused
- NiFi processors can be dynamically configured with user-provided connection details
- ETL pipelines can be executed between different database systems
- Existing "Manage Pipeline" functionality continues to work
